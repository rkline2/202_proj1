# Fifteen Game

## 1. Assignment Description
Your assignment is to develop the fifteen game (using text) where the user tries to put each of the tiles into order. On each turn, the user can slide any tile adjacent to a blank into the blank location.

The game continues until all fifteen tiles are in order as shown in figure 1 above. It should then prompt the user for another game.

## 2.	Background
The fifteen (15 or 16 puzzle) is a common sliding puzzle that you may remember from your youth. 
It involves a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The object of
the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

For this effort, we are going to create a game board that the user can manipulate in order to get a board that is out of order into a correct order. Additionally, the game will indicate when the game is “solved” by putting the tiles into the correct location.

The game board will be represented by a two-dimensional grid. The actual implementation of how you want to create the grid is up to your design decisions, but you must meet all requirements listed below for full points.

The user will be able to “slide” any tile to an empty location. If the user tries to slide the tile into a location that is already populated or off of the board, the system will indicate that it is not possible. While we can make the grid of any size, we will start with a standard 4 by 4.

## 3. Overview
In this project, you will:
  *	Practice basic C++ syntax including branching structures
  *	Write a program that calls multiple functions
  *	Manage a two-dimensional array
  *	Use simple file input/output
